# Projects

Hello!

I am @janyamirpuri, a sophomore at NYU studying Mathematics as my major, with a minor in Data Science.
I can be contacted through the email janyamirpuri@gmail.com, or through my school email, jm8808@nyu.edu.

In this repository, you will find projects I have worked on in my courses (with the permission of the professors), as well as projects I have taken on my own.
I am open to any feedback!
