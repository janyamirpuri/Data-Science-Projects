       "   'description': \"<b>From the author of <i>Expecting Better</i> and <i>The Family Firm</i>, an economist's guide to the early years of parenting.<br /><br />“Both refreshing and useful. With so many parenting theories driving us all a bit batty, this is the type of book that we need to help calm things down.” —<i>LA Times</i></b><br /><br /><b>“The book is jampacked with information, but it’s also a delightful read because Oster is such a good writer.”&#xa0;—<i>NPR</i></b><br /><br /> With <i>Expecting Better</i>, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In <i>Cribsheet</i>, she now tackles an even greater challenge: decision-making in the early years of parenting.&#xa0;<br /><br /> As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and strangers on the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule—or three—for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the trade-offs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision?&#xa0;<br /><br /> Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths around breastfeeding (not a panacea), sleep training (not so bad!), potty training (wait until they're ready or possibly bribe with M&amp;Ms), language acquisition (early talkers aren't necessarily geniuses), and many other topics. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time.&#xa0;<br /><br /> Economics is the science of decision-making, and <i>Cribsheet</i> is a thinking parent's guide to the chaos and frequent misinformation of the early years. Emily Oster is a trained expert—and mom of two—who can empower us to make better, less fraught decisions—and stay sane in the years before preschool.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias in time, money, and often with their lives.<br /><br />Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates the shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in <i>Invisible Women</i>, diving into women's lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor's office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable expose that will change the way you look at the world.\"},\n",

       "   'description': '<b>From “one of the great (greatest?) contemporary popular writers on economics” (Tyler Cowen) comes a smart, lively, and encouraging rethinking of how to use statistics<i>.</i></b><br /><br /> Today we think statistics are the enemy, numbers used to mislead and confuse us. That’s a mistake, Tim Harford says in <i>The Data Detective</i>. We shouldn’t be suspicious of statistics—we need to understand what they mean and how they can improve our lives: they are, at heart, human behavior seen through the prism of numbers and are often “the only way of grasping much of what is going on around us.” If we can toss aside our fears and learn to approach them clearly—understanding how our own preconceptions lead us astray—statistics can point to ways we can live better and work smarter.<br /><br /> As “perhaps the best popular economics writer in the world” (<i>New Statesman</i>), Tim Harford is an expert at taking complicated ideas and untangling them for millions of readers. In <i>The Data Detective</i>, he uses new research in science and psychology to set out ten strategies for using statistics to erase our biases and replace them with new ideas that use virtues like patience, curiosity, and good sense to better understand ourselves and the world. As a result, <i>The Data Detective</i> is a big-idea book about statistics and human behavior that is fresh, unexpected, and insightful.'},\n",

       "   'description': '<b>Audie Award Finalist, Business/Educational, 2014</b><br /><br />Once considered tedious, the field of statistics is rapidly evolving into a discipline Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, has actually called \"sexy\". From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you\\'ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in <i>Naked Statistics,</i> the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. <br /><br />For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions. <br /><br />You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show <i>Let’s Make a Deal</i> - and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned <i>Naked Economics</i> into a best seller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.'},\n",

Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we can get a job or a loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by machines. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules.<br />&#xa0;<br />But as mathematician and data scientist Cathy O’Neil reveals, the mathematical models being used today are unregulated and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination—propping up the lucky, punishing the downtrodden, and undermining our democracy in the process. Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.'},\n",

She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals.&#xa0;<br /><br />One day, she is approached by a ragtag bunch of misfits who say they want to overthrow the existing order, to liberate developers, to bring joy back to technology work, and to enable the business to win in a time of digital disruption. To her surprise, she finds herself drawn ever further into this movement, eventually becoming one of the leaders of the Rebellion, which puts her in the crosshairs of some familiar and very dangerous enemies.&#xa0;<br /><br />The Age of Software is here, and another mass extinction event looms - this is a story about rebel developers and business leaders working together, racing against time to innovate, survive, and thrive in a time of unprecedented uncertainty...and opportunity.&#xa0;&#xa0;'},\n",

But we live with the consequences of our decisions for much longer. What\\'s the right kind of school and at what age should a particular kid start? How do you encourage a healthy diet? Should kids play a sport and how seriously? How do you think smartly about encouraging children\\'s independence? Along with these bigger questions, Oster investigates how to navigate the complexity of day-to-day family logistics.<br /><br />Making these decisions is less about finding the specific answer and more about taking the right approach. Parents of this age are often still working in baby mode, which is to say, under stress and on the fly. That is a classic management problem, and Oster takes a page from her time as a business school professor at the University of Chicago to show us that thoughtful business process can help smooth out tough family decisions.<br /><br /><i>The Family Firm</i> is a smart and winning guide to how to think clearly--and with less ambient stress--about the key decisions of the elementary school years.<br /><br /><b>Parenting is a full-time job. It\\'s time we start treating it like one.<br /></b>'},\n",

Our media environment has become hyperpartisan. Science is conducted by press release. Startup culture elevates bullshit to high art. We are fairly well equipped to spot the sort of old-school bullshit that is based in fancy rhetoric and weasel words, but most of us don’t feel qualified to challenge the avalanche of new-school bullshit presented in the language of math, science, or statistics. In&#xa0;<i>Calling Bullshit,</i>&#xa0;Professors Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West give us a set of powerful tools to cut through the most intimidating data. <br /><br />You don’t need a lot of technical expertise to call out problems with data. Are the numbers or results too good or too dramatic to be true? Is the claim comparing like with like? Is it confirming your personal bias? Drawing on a deep well of expertise in statistics and computational biology, Bergstrom and West exuberantly unpack examples of selection bias and muddled data visualization, distinguish between correlation and causation, and examine the susceptibility of science to modern bullshit. <br /><br />We have always needed people who call bullshit when necessary, whether within a circle of friends, a community of scholars, or the citizenry of a nation. Now that bullshit has evolved, we need to relearn the art of skepticism.<br /><br /><b>This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF that contains multiple examples of bullshit in the form of charts, graphs, and illustrations from the book.</b>'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Marcin Zukowski, Thierry Cruanes, and Benoit Dageville had a mission. As Snowflake’s founders, they wanted to make all types of data available to anybody with permission to use it via a simple and inexpensive mechanism. Their collective efforts drove the breakthrough creation of the Data Cloud. Snowflake’s Data Cloud platform ingests available data and transforms it into information. Without the ability to effectively process, data is just a collection of raw facts. If data can be managed, processed, and organized, the resulting information can be harnessed to make data-driven decisions. Data Cloud allows organizations to fully automate many core business processes — making them more efficient, massively scalable, and less prone to error.&#xa0;<br /><br />Suppose you’re an IT manager responsible for managing data. Your frustrations with disconnected datasets, hardware storage constraints, lack of unique identifiers between multiple datasets and access to analytics is making you and your organization less effective. This book will give you an understanding of what we’ve built to help you create a business with data as its most robust foundation.<br /><br />Snowflake delivers the Data Cloud — a global network where thousands of organizations mobilize data with near-unlimited scale, concurrency, and performance. Inside the Data Cloud, organizations unite their siloes of data, easily discover and securely share governed data, and execute diverse analytic workloads. Wherever data or users live, Snowflake delivers a single and seamless experience across multiple public clouds, helping power the data economy. Snowflake’s platform is the engine that powers and provides access to the Data Cloud, creating a solution for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and data sharing.'},\n",

This not only entails the emergence of specialised operators in these activities, but also makes a “data economy” possible.<br /><br />In this regard, it expands the profitability of business models based on data and gives more strategic value to the collection thereof.&#xa0;The increased possibilities of obtaining revenue from the information lends greater efficiency to the strategy of setting a price of zero&#xa0;in one of the markets on which platform-type (two-sided) business models depend.<br /><br />However, the market in which an operator offers its service at zero cost is not free from possible competition problems in parameters other than price&#xa0;(significantly, quality: whether understood as adequately classified information or the level of privacy offered to users).<br /><br />Some of the most recent and significant changes that technology has stimulated in the economy have included the appearance of multiple operators that base their business model on the processing of information and can access it thanks to (i)&#xa0;increased digitisation&#xa0;(conversion of physical assets into information),&#xa0;which has enabled&#xa0;digital interactions&#xa0;(unlike physical interactions,&#xa0;they leave a record&#xa0;– information), and (ii)&#xa0;a large volume of information&#xa0;(Internet and sensors).'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The essential playbook for the future of your business. <br /><br /><i>What to Do When Machines Do Everything</i> is a guidebook to succeeding in the next generation of the digital economy. When systems running on artificial intelligence can drive our cars, diagnose medical patients, and manage our finances more effectively than humans, it raises profound questions on the future of work and how companies compete. Illustrated with real-world cases, data, and insight, the authors provide clear strategic guidance and actionable steps to help you and your organization move ahead in a world where exponentially developing new technologies are changing how value is created. <br /><br />Written by a team of business and technology expert practitioners - who also authored <i>Code Halos: How the Digital Lives of People, Things, and Organizations are Changing the Rules of Business</i> - this book provides a clear path to the future of your work. <br /><br />The first part of the book examines the once in a generation upheaval most every organization will soon face as systems of intelligence go mainstream. The authors argue that contrary to the doom and gloom that surrounds much of IT and business at the moment, we are in fact on the cusp of the biggest wave of opportunity creation since the Industrial Revolution. Next, the authors detail a clear-cut business model to help leaders take part in this coming boom. The AHEAD model outlines five strategic initiatives - Automate, Halos, Enhance, Abundance, and Discovery - that are central to competing in the next phase of global business by driving new levels of efficiency, customer intimacy and innovation. <br /><br />Business leaders today have two options: be swallowed up by the ongoing technological evolution, or ride the crest of the wave to new profits and better business. This book shows you how to avoid your own extinction event, and will help you: <br /> \\n \\n \\n Understand the untold full extent of technology's impact on the way we work and live  \\n Find out where we're headed, and how soon the future will arrive  \\n Leverage the new emerging paradigm into a sustainable business advantage  \\n Adopt a strategic model for winning in the new economy  \\n \\nThe digital world is already transforming how we work, live, and shop, how we are governed and entertained, and how we manage our money, health, security, and relationships. Don't let your business - or your career - get left behind. \\n<i>What to Do When Machines Do Everything</i> is your strategic roadmap to a future full of possibility and success. Or peril.\"},\n",

But then came Netflix\\'s <i>House of Cards</i>. Netflix gauged the show\\'s potential from data it had gathered about subscribers\\' preferences, ordered two seasons without seeing a pilot, and uploaded the first thirteen episodes all at once for viewers to watch whenever they wanted on the devices of their choice.&#xa0;<br /><br />In this book, Michael Smith and Rahul Telang, experts on entertainment analytics, show how the success of <i>House of Cards</i> upended the film and TV industries - and how companies like Amazon and Apple are changing the rules in other entertainment industries, notably publishing and music. We\\'re living through a period of unprecedented technological disruption in the entertainment industries. Just about everything is affected: pricing, production, distribution, piracy. Smith and Telang discuss niche products and the long tail, product differentiation, price discrimination, and incentives for users not to steal content. To survive and succeed, businesses have to adapt rapidly and creatively. Smith and Telang explain how.&#xa0;<br /><br />How can companies discover who their customers are, what they want, and how much they are willing to pay for it? Data.

       "   'description': 'Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In <i>Data Feminism</i>, Catherine D\\'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<br /><br />Illustrating data feminism in action, D\\'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever \"speak for themselves.\"<br /><br /><i>Data Feminism</i> offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'An unflinching look at the aspiring city-builders of our smart, mobile, connected future. <br /><br />We live in a world defined by urbanization and digital ubiquity, where mobile broadband connections outnumber fixed ones, machines dominate a new \"internet of things,\" and more people live in cities than in the countryside. <br /><br />In <i>Smart Cities,</i> urbanist and technology expert Anthony Townsend takes a broad historical look at the forces that have shaped the planning and design of cities and information technologies from the rise of the great industrial cities of the nineteenth century to the present. A century ago, the telegraph and the mechanical tabulator were used to tame cities of millions. Today, cellular networks and cloud computing tie together the complex choreography of mega-regions of tens of millions of people. <br /><br />In response, cities worldwide are deploying technology to address both the timeless challenges of government and the mounting problems posed by human settlements of previously unimaginable size and complexity. In Chicago, GPS sensors on snow plows feed a real-time \"plow tracker\" map that everyone can access. In Zaragoza, Spain, a \"citizen card\" can get you on the free city-wide Wi-Fi network, unlock a bike share, check a book out of the library, and pay for your bus ride home. In New York, a guerrilla group of citizen-scientists installed sensors in local sewers to alert you when storm water runoff overwhelms the system, dumping waste into local waterways. <br /><br />As technology barons, entrepreneurs, mayors, and an emerging vanguard of civic hackers are trying to shape this new frontier, Smart Cities considers the motivations, aspirations, and shortcomings of them all while offering a new civics to guide our efforts as we build the future together, one click at a time.'},\n",

Authors Tomasz Tunguz and Frank Bien draw on extensive background in big data, business intelligence, and business strategy to provide a blueprint for companies looking to move head-on into the data wave. Instrumentation is discussed in detail, but the core of the change is in the culture - this book provides sound guidance on building the type of organizational culture that creates and leverages data daily, in every aspect of the business. Real-world examples illustrate these important concepts at work: you'll learn how data helped Warby-Parker disrupt a $13 billion monopolized market, how ThredUp uses data to process more than 20,000 items of clothing every day, how Venmo leverages data to build better products, how HubSpot empowers their salespeople to be more productive, and more. From decision making and strategy to shipping and sales, this book shows you how data makes better business. <br /><br />Big data has taken on buzzword status, but there is little real guidance for companies seeking everyday business data solutions. This book takes a deeper look at big data in business, and shows you how to shift internal culture ahead of the curve. <br /> \\n \\n Understand the changes a data culture brings to companies  \\n Instrument your company for maximum benefit  \\n Utilize data to optimize every aspect of your business  \\n Improve decision making and transform business strategy  \\n \\n \\n \\n<br />Big data is becoming the number-one topic in business, yet no one is asking the right questions. Leveraging the full power of data requires more than good IT - organization-wide buy-in is essential for long-term success. <i>Winning with Data</i> is the expert guide to making data work for your business, and your needs.\"},\n",

       "   'description': '<b>Newly adapted for audiobook listeners.</b><br /><br />Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?<br /><br />In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.<br /><br />Peer under the hood of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and operate them more effectively.<br /><br />Make informed decisions by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different tools.<br /><br />Navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity.<br /><br />Understand the distributed systems research upon which modern databases are built.<br /><br />Peek behind the scenes of major online services, and learn from their architectures.'},\n",

Part intuitive artist, part statistical modeler and part programmer, the practitioner of this new art of research must be able to detect and make sense out of patterns hidden within millions upon millions of pieces of constantly streaming, completely unstructured data. <br /><br />He or she must also must be able to smooth and clean the data, ask the right questions about that data, make valid inferences from the data as to how consumers and markets behave, and create statistical models with which to pinpoint behavioral triggers which prove or disprove their theories. <br /><br />Jonathan Goldman, who administered the data science team behind LinkedIn\\'s highly successful \"People You May Know\" button, notes that data scientists are sometimes referred to as \"unicorns\" simply because the combination of skills and talents required to do their job is so rare and hard to find. <br /><br />In <i>Unicorns Among Us</i>, Lars Nielsen lays out the brief history of data science since its beginnings not long ago in this century. He as well explores the evolution of the role of the data scientist through this same period, and explores the best qualifications, the tools, the techniques, and the training involved in the practice of this arcane discipline. <br /><br />Nielsen\\'s audiobook will prove indispensable for anyone contemplating a career in this lucrative area, as well as any novice tasked to work with a data science team.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"This book appeals to the listener's desire to explore the world of data science in a manner that is not too technical and not too plain, but somewhere in between. This book targets this sweet spot and provides comprehensive yet brief explanations to concepts that might be otherwise misunderstood or easily ignored by the listener due to their inherent complexity.<br /><br />This book covers the very key and fundamental concepts toward systematically understanding data science by drawing a well-defined road map addressing each topic in such a way that every section of every chapter reinforces the concepts and information laid out in the previous chapters. The main focus of this book is to give the listener insight into the processes involved in data science projects and shed light onto some of the most common aspects of data science, including big data and how it impacts the world. This book attempts to build a solid foundation of the concepts pertaining to data science. It will prove to be the infrastructure that will lead you to one day become a data science expert. In short, this book has all the necessary information a beginner-level data scientist would have, along with setting up for future improvement by reinforcing this knowledge with the intermediate and expert level books of the data science series.&#xa0;Are you interested in learning one of the sexiest jobs of the century? That’s what Harvard Business School terms data science as. Let’s face it - data scientists possess skills and qualities that are in more demand now than ever before, and that’s not surprising, given the sheer amount of data the world produces.<br /><br />So, what is data science?&#xa0;It’s all data, and it’s about transforming it into something that businesses can use, and data scientists do this with a great deal of skill and knowledge in math, statistics, algorithms, and more. At first glance, you might dismiss data science as being far too hard to learn, but it’s like anything else - break it down into smaller parts, and you’ll find it much easier to grasp.&#xa0;That’s what I’ve done here - broken the subject down into each of its realms, to give you a better idea of what it is all about.&#xa0;In this book, you will learn:&#xa0;<br /><br />\\nWhat data science is&#xa0;\\nHow data science relates to and differs from artificial intelligence and machine learning&#xa0;\\nMath and statistics\\nDescriptive and inferential analysis&#xa0;\\nWhat data engineering is&#xa0;\\nWhat data visualization is&#xa0;\\nThe different types of visualization&#xa0;\\nAn introduction to Seaborn&#xa0;\\nWhat machine learning is and how it relates to data science&#xa0;\\nDifferent types of machine learning&#xa0;\\nDifferent ML algorithms&#xa0;\\nThe steps required for successful machine learning&#xa0;\\n\\n<br />Along the way, you will find plenty of practical examples, and we finish off with a series of questions you might be asked at a data science interview, along with detailed answers, and a glossary of terms.&#xa0;Don’t waste any more time; start your data science journey today by clicking the buy now button.&#xa0;\"},\n",

       "   'description': '<b>Award-winning poet and essayist Anne Boyer delivers a one-of-a-kind meditation on illness in the age of data—sharing her true story of coping with cancer, both the illness and the industry, in <i>The Undying</i>.</b><br /><br />A week after her forty-first birthday, the acclaimed poet Anne Boyer was diagnosed with highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. For a single mother living paycheck to paycheck who had always been the caregiver rather than the one needing care, the catastrophic illness was both a crisis and an initiation into new ideas about mortality and the gendered politics of illness. A twenty-first-century Illness as Metaphor, as well as a harrowing memoir of survival, <i>The Undying</i> explores the experience of illness as mediated by digital screens, weaving in ancient Roman dream diarists, cancer hoaxers and fetishists, cancer vloggers, corporate lies, John Donne, pro-pain \"dolorists,\" the ecological costs of chemotherapy, and the many little murders of capitalism. It excoriates the pharmaceutical industry and the bland hypocrisies of \"pink ribbon culture\" while also diving into the long literary line of women writing about their own illnesses and ongoing deaths: Audre Lorde, Kathy Acker, Susan Sontag, and others.<br /><br />A genre-bending memoir in the tradition of <i>The Argonauts</i>, <i>The Undying</i> will break your heart, make you angry enough to spit, and show you contemporary America as a thing both desperately ill and occasionally, perversely glorious.'},\n",

The data is stored, studied, and bought and sold by corporations and governments for surveillance and for control.  “Foremost security expert” (Wired) and best-selling author Bruce Schneier shows how this data has led to a double-edged internet – a Web that gives power that gives power to the people but is abused by the institutions on which those people depend. In DATA AND GOLIATH, Schneier reveals the full extent of surveillance, censorship, and propaganda in society today, examining the risks of cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberwar.  He shares technological, legal, and social solutions that can help shape a more equal, private, and secure world.  This is a book everyone with an internet connection – or bank account, or smart device, or car, for that matter – needs to read.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning.<br /><br />Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems.<br /><br />The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Organizations invest incredible amounts of time and money in obtaining and then storing big data in stores called data lakes. But how many of these organizations can actually get the data back out in a useable form? Very few can turn a data lake into an information gold mine. Most wind up with garbage dumps. <br /><br /><i>Data Lake Architecture</i> will explain how to build a useful data lake where data scientists and data analysts can solve business challenges and identify new business opportunities. Learn how to structure data lakes as well as analog, application, and text-based data ponds to provide maximum business value. Understand the role of the raw data pond and when to use an archival data pond. Leverage the four key ingredients for data lake success: metadata, integration mapping, context, and metaprocess. <br /><br />Bill Inmon opened our eyes to the architecture and benefits of a data warehouse, and now he takes us to the next level of data lake architecture.'}]}"
